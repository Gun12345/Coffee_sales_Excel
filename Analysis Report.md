### Project Overview
---
This is a project done to help me improve my data analysis skills in Excel. It features a dataset about a fictional coffee shop that sells different types of coffee at different sizes and roasts. The aim of this project is to gain insights into the sales of each product and certain customer behaviour.
### Exploratory Questions

Here are some questions that served as a guide for insights:
1. What is best selling coffee type over the years?

### Data Sources

The data is contained in the [coffeeOrdersDashboard.xlsx](coffeeOrdersDashboard.xlsx) file along with the dashboard.
### Tools Used

- The customer with the most money spent is Alis Wilmore with total purchases of $317
- The best selling coffee type is Liberica, then Arabica, Excelsa and Robusta is the least popular.
  
### Recommendations
---
Based on some of my findings, here are some recommendations I would offer:

1. **Focus on Expanding in the United States:**
   Given that the United States has the highest total sales, consider concentrating marketing efforts and resources on expanding and optimizing operations in the U.S. Identify specific strategies to attract more customers or increase sales in this region, such as targeted promotions, loyalty programs, or market-specific offerings.

2. **Customer Engagement with High Spenders:**
   Develop a customer engagement strategy to retain and potentially increase spending from high-value customers like Alis Wilmore. Consider implementing a personalized loyalty program, sending exclusive offers, or seeking feedback to enhance the overall customer experience. Strengthening relationships with top spenders can contribute significantly to overall sales growth.

3. **Diversify Coffee Offerings:**
   Recognizing the popularity of Liberica, Arabica, and Excelsa, explore opportunities to diversify the coffee menu further. Introduce new coffee blends or variations to attract a broader customer base and potentially increase sales. Conduct market research to understand local preferences in each country and tailor offerings accordingly. This strategy can help tap into different segments of the market and enhance overall product appeal.
